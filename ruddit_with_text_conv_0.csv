There are all sorts of reasons why a child came unplanned into her life, something which had a detrimental impact on her potential job earnings. And if you count the total number of caloric hours of labor undertaken by men and women, women work between 20 to 30 percent more per week than men, on average. Because, yes, child care and home making is labor, albeit unpaid.

42g75o,czaeclj,">Doesn't it also mean the husband choose for his wife to earn less? If a husband and wife want a stay at home parent and decide together in mutual agreement for the wife to quit her job, then the choice for the woman to earn less rests equally on both man and woman in that situation.

Generally, couples opt for one partner to stay home and care for the kids because daycare is *expensive*. For babies, it can be $25,000/year expensive. If you make $40,000/year, that's basically your take-home after taxes. So, unless both partners are high wage earners, it usually makes more economic sense for one to stay home. No one wants to work a full-time job just to pay for someone else to take care of their child.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/42g75o/cmv_the_so_called_wage_gap_is_a_myth//czaeclj/,0.083,0.043646812,0.001516342,0.016479544,0.013546381,0.017936565,0.006440342,1453670075.0,1,0,0,iglidante,1152.0,267.0,30408.0,345793.0,377620.0
